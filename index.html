     <p>Amenra is a Belgian band from Kortrijk. It was formed in 1999 by
     vocalist Colin H. van Eeckhout and guitarist Mathieu Vandekerckhove,
     who now perform alongside drummer Bjorn Lebon, guitarist Lennart Bossu
     and bassist Tim De Gieter. Among a number of other works, they have
     released six studio albums in the Mass series, the latest of them
     through Neurot Recordings. The band's unique musical style, characterised
     by brooding atmospheres and spiritual intensity, is rooted in doom metal,
     hardcore punk and post-rock. Their live performances, accompanied by
     visual art, have been described as "entrancing communions".[1] In 2005,
     Amenra formed Church of Ra, a collective of collaborating artists which
     now includes Oathbreaker and the Black Heart Rebellion.</p>
