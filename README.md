**Homework for FreeIT.**

**Little description**

*This is the firs README.md to try use GitHub.*
Here I need to write something to describe my project but there is no so mush information about.

1. I have to make a repository.
2. I have to make a one line web page.
3. I have to commit it to `GitHub`.

> Thanks `FreeIT` for motivation.

I use this as an example:
- [*Art of README*](https://github.com/noffle/art-of-readme).

```shell
Good luck for me.
```
